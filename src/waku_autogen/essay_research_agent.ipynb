      "    <summary>  Recent months have seen the emergence of a powerful new trend in which large\n",
      "language models (LLMs) are augmented to become autonomous language agents\n",
      "capable of performing objective oriented multi-step tasks on their own, rather\n",
      "than merely responding to queries from human users. Most existing language\n",
      "agents, however, are not optimized using environment-specific rewards. Although\n",
      "some agents enable iterative refinement through verbal feedback, they do not\n",
      "reason and plan in ways that are compatible with gradient-based learning from\n",
      "rewards. This paper introduces a principled framework for reinforcing large\n",
      "language agents by learning a retrospective model, which automatically tunes\n",
      "the language agent prompts from environment feedback through policy gradient.\n",
      "Specifically, our proposed agent architecture learns from rewards across\n",
      "multiple environments and tasks, for fine-tuning a pre-trained language model\n",
      "which refines the language agent prompt by summarizing the root cause of prior\n",
      "failed attempts and proposing action plans. Experimental results on various\n",
      "tasks demonstrate that the language agents improve over time and that our\n",
      "approach considerably outperforms baselines that do not properly leverage\n",
      "gradients from the environment. This demonstrates that using policy gradient\n",

      "of the first, seems promising and can be applied to optimize other models in\n",

      "The convergence of LLMs and agent architectures presents a dynamic frontier for AI research. The papers discussed highlight a common trend: the transition from simple task-response systems to more nuanced models capable of understanding context, reasoning, and learning from experience. Objective benchmarks, like the STSS, play a pivotal role in evaluating agent capabilities, providing transparency that can drive improvements. Likewise, the integration of feedback mechanisms, showcased by the Retroformer, illustrates the necessity for agents to adapt continuously. Finally, applying LLMs in practical domains, such as manufacturing, signifies a trend toward utilizing these models in real-world scenarios, reflecting their potential for industry and autonomous systems.\n",

In\\nthis work, we introduce a new task, Proactive Agent Planning, which requires\\nlanguage agents to predict clarification needs based on user-agent conversation\\nand agent-environment interaction, invoke external tools to collect valid\\ninformation, and generate a plan to fulfill the user\\'s demands. To study this\\npractical problem, we establish a new benchmark dataset, Ask-before-Plan. To\\ntackle the deficiency of LLMs in proactive planning, we propose a novel\\nmulti-agent framework, Clarification-Execution-Planning (\\\\texttt{CEP}), which\\nconsists of three agents specialized in clarification, execution, and planning.\\nWe introduce the trajectory tuning scheme for the clarification agent and\\nstatic execution agent, as well as the memory recollection mechanism for the\\ndynamic execution agent.

However, existing single-agent approaches face limitations in\\ngenerating and improving large-scale, complex codebases due to constraints in\\ncontext length. To tackle this challenge, we propose Self-Organized multi-Agent\\nframework (SoA), a novel multi-agent framework that enables the scalable and\\nefficient generation and optimization of large-scale code. In SoA,\\nself-organized agents operate independently to generate and modify code\\ncomponents while seamlessly collaborating to construct the overall codebase. A\\nkey feature of our framework is the automatic multiplication of agents based on\\nproblem complexity, allowing for dynamic scalability. This enables the overall\\ncode volume to be increased indefinitely according to the number of agents,\\nwhile the amount of code managed by each agent remains constant. We evaluate\\nSoA on the HumanEval benchmark and demonstrate that, compared to a single-agent\\nsystem, each agent in SoA handles significantly less code, yet the overall\\ngenerated code is substantially greater. Moreover, SoA surpasses the powerful\\nsingle-agent baseline by 5% in terms of Pass@1 accuracy.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Yoichi Ishibashi</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Yoshimasa Nishimura</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02183v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02183v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.SE\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.SE\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.AI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.CL\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.LG\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.MA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15073v1</id>\\n    <updated>2024-07-21T06:21:47Z</updated>\\n    <published>2024-07-21T06:21:47Z</published>\\n    <title>Multi-Agent Causal Discovery Using Large Language Models</title>\\n    <summary>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in\\ncausal discovery tasks by utilizing their vast expert knowledge from extensive\\ntext corpora.

These **agents** use LLMs to not only understand and generate human-like responses across varied domains but also to perform complex tasks autonomously. Agents, in this context, refer to AI systems that can perceive their environment, process information, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Understanding how agents function within this framework is crucial for improving their overall effectiveness and adaptability. This essay explores recent advancements in the study of agents within LLMs, drawing insights from three significant papers published on arXiv, which underscore the importance of objective evaluation, feedback mechanisms, and real-world applications.\\n\\n## Paper Summaries and Insights\\n\\n### Towards Objectively Benchmarking Social Intelligence for Language Agents at Action Level\\n**Authors:** Chenxu Wang, Bin Dai, Huaping Liu, Baoyuan Wang  \\n**[Link to paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05337v1)**  \\nThis paper introduces the **Social Tasks in Sandbox Simulation (STSS)** benchmark, aimed at evaluating language agents' social intelligence beyond traditional metrics that focus solely on language outputs or rely on subjective assessments. The authors argue for an objective action-level assessment, focusing on how well agents achieve goals in multi-agent simulations. This objective benchmark not only provides a clearer picture of an agent's capabilities but also differentiates between the intricacies of various architectures. This work underscores the importance of a realistic environment in testing the social intelligence of LLM-based agents.\\n\\n### Retroformer: Retrospective Large Language Agents with Policy Gradient Optimization\\n**Authors:** Weiran Yao, Shelby Heinecke, Juan Carlos Niebles, Zhiwei Liu, and others  \\n**[Link to paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02151v3)**  \\nIn this paper, the authors present a pioneering framework for optimizing LLMs as agents through **policy gradient optimization**. The proposed method, dubbed **Retroformer**, enhances the performance of language agents by refining their operational prompts based on feedback from their environment. Experimental results highlight a significant improvement in agent performance on various tasks, illustrating the effectiveness of learning from iterative feedback loops rather than static training paradigms. This approach marks a crucial step toward developing more adaptive and efficient agent architectures.\\n\\n### Large Language Model-Enabled Multi-Agent Manufacturing Systems\\n**Authors:** Jonghan Lim, Birgit Vogel-Heuser, Ilya Kovalenko  \\n**[Link to paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01893v2)**  \\nThis research examines the integration of LLMs in **multi-agent manufacturing systems** to boost operational adaptability. By allowing agents to interpret and execute instructions in natural language, this framework enhances the overall efficiency and responsiveness of manufacturing processes. The authors demonstrate that LLMs can effectively bridge the gap between complex human instructions and machine understanding, paving the way for a more flexible and intelligent operational landscape. Through concrete case studies, the findings reveal the potential of employing language models to enhance agent collaboration and decision-making in various contexts.\\n\\n## Conceptual Discussion\\nThe convergence of LLMs and agent architectures presents a dynamic frontier for AI research. The papers discussed highlight a common trend: the transition from simple task-response systems to more nuanced models capable of understanding context, reasoning, and learning from experience. Objective benchmarks, like the STSS, play a pivotal role in evaluating agent capabilities, providing transparency that can drive improvements. Likewise, the integration of feedback mechanisms, showcased by the Retroformer, illustrates the necessity for agents to adapt continuously. Finally, applying LLMs in practical domains, such as manufacturing, signifies a trend toward utilizing these models in real-world scenarios, reflecting their potential for industry and autonomous systems.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\nAs research in LLM-based agents continues to evolve, it becomes increasingly evident that the integration of advanced evaluation metrics, adaptive learning techniques, and real-world applications is vital for unlocking their full potential. Moreover, as we improve agent capabilities, we must also consider the ethical implications of these advancements, particularly concerning the autonomy and decision-making processes of AI systems. The insights derived from recent studies not only highlight the importance of rigorous benchmarks and optimization strategies but also pave the way for future developments in AI agent systems. By focusing on these areas, researchers can foster the growth of capable, efficient, and intelligent agents that can navigate complex environments and tasks effectively, setting the stage for innovative applications in everyday life. \\n\\nWe invite our readers to share their thoughts on these advancements and engage in discussions about the future of agents in AI, as collaborative exploration will undoubtedly drive the field forward.\\n\\n## References\\n1. **Towards Objectively Benchmarking Social Intelligence for Language Agents at Action Level** - [arXiv:2404.05337v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05337v1)\\n2. **Retroformer: Retrospective Large Language Agents with Policy Gradient Optimization** - [arXiv:2308.02151v3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02151v3)\\n3. **Large Language Model-Enabled Multi-Agent Manufacturing Systems** - [arXiv:2406.01893v2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01893v2)\\n```\\n\\nI've made the final adjustments by introducing a **References** section and a **Call to Action** in the conclusion.

Despite these\\nadvancements, the potential of LLM-powered agents to comprehend ambiguous user\\ninstructions for reasoning and decision-making is still under exploration. In\\nthis work, we introduce a new task, Proactive Agent Planning, which requires\\nlanguage agents to predict clarification needs based on user-agent conversation\\nand agent-environment interaction, invoke external tools to collect valid\\ninformation, and generate a plan to fulfill the user\\'s demands.

However, existing single-agent approaches face limitations in\\ngenerating and improving large-scale, complex codebases due to constraints in\\ncontext length. To tackle this challenge, we propose Self-Organized multi-Agent\\nframework (SoA), a novel multi-agent framework that enables the scalable and\\nefficient generation and optimization of large-scale code. In SoA,\\nself-organized agents operate independently to generate and modify code\\ncomponents while seamlessly collaborating to construct the overall codebase. A\\nkey feature of our framework is the automatic multiplication of agents based on\\nproblem complexity, allowing for dynamic scalability. This enables the overall\\ncode volume to be increased indefinitely according to the number of agents,\\nwhile the amount of code managed by each agent remains constant. We evaluate\\nSoA on the HumanEval benchmark and demonstrate that, compared to a single-agent\\nsystem, each agent in SoA handles significantly less code, yet the overall\\ngenerated code is substantially greater. Moreover, SoA surpasses the powerful\\nsingle-agent baseline by 5% in terms of Pass@1 accuracy.\\n</summary>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Yoichi Ishibashi</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <author>\\n      <name>Yoshimasa Nishimura</name>\\n    </author>\\n    <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02183v1\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"text/html\"/>\\n    <link title=\"pdf\" href=\"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02183v1\" rel=\"related\" type=\"application/pdf\"/>\\n    <arxiv:primary_category xmlns:arxiv=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\" term=\"cs.SE\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.SE\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.AI\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.CL\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.LG\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n    <category term=\"cs.MA\" scheme=\"http://arxiv.org/schemas/atom\"/>\\n  </entry>\\n  <entry>\\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15073v1</id>\\n    <updated>2024-07-21T06:21:47Z</updated>\\n    <published>2024-07-21T06:21:47Z</published>\\n    <title>Multi-Agent Causal Discovery Using Large Language Models</title>\\n    <summary>  Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in\\ncausal discovery tasks by utilizing their vast expert knowledge from extensive\\ntext corpora.

Despite the remarkable progress, we notice that existing\\nworks are heavily dependent on human-designed frameworks, which greatly limits\\nthe functional scope and scalability of agent systems. How to automatically\\nextend the specialized agent to multi-agent systems to improve task-solving\\ncapability still remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce\\nEvoAgent, a generic method to automatically extend expert agents to multi-agent\\nsystems via the evolutionary algorithm, thereby improving the effectiveness of\\nLLM-based agents in solving tasks. Specifically, we consider the existing agent\\nframeworks as the initial individual and then apply a series of evolutionary\\noperators (e.g., mutation, crossover, selection, etc.) to generate multiple\\nagents with diverse agent settings. EvoAgent can be generalized to any\\nLLM-based agent framework, and can automatically extend the existing agent\\nframework to multi-agent systems without any extra human designs.

These **agents** use LLMs to not only understand and generate human-like responses across varied domains but also to perform complex tasks autonomously. Agents, in this context, refer to AI systems that can perceive their environment, process information, and take actions to achieve specific goals. Understanding how agents function within this framework is crucial for improving their overall effectiveness and adaptability. This essay explores recent advancements in the study of agents within LLMs, drawing insights from three significant papers published on arXiv, which underscore the importance of objective evaluation, feedback mechanisms, and real-world applications.\\n\\n## Paper Summaries and Insights\\n\\n### Towards Objectively Benchmarking Social Intelligence for Language Agents at Action Level\\n**Authors:** Chenxu Wang, Bin Dai, Huaping Liu, Baoyuan Wang  \\n**[Link to paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05337v1)**  \\nThis paper introduces the **Social Tasks in Sandbox Simulation (STSS)** benchmark, aimed at evaluating language agents' social intelligence beyond traditional metrics that focus solely on language outputs or rely on subjective assessments. The authors argue for an objective action-level assessment, focusing on how well agents achieve goals in multi-agent simulations. This objective benchmark not only provides a clearer picture of an agent's capabilities but also differentiates between the intricacies of various architectures.

The proposed method, dubbed **Retroformer**, enhances the performance of language agents by refining their operational prompts based on feedback from their environment. Experimental results highlight a significant improvement in agent performance on various tasks, illustrating the effectiveness of learning from iterative feedback loops rather than static training paradigms. This approach marks a crucial step toward developing more adaptive and efficient agent architectures.\\n\\n### Large Language Model-Enabled Multi-Agent Manufacturing Systems\\n**Authors:** Jonghan Lim, Birgit Vogel-Heuser, Ilya Kovalenko  \\n**[Link to paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01893v2)**  \\nThis research examines the integration of LLMs in **multi-agent manufacturing systems** to boost operational adaptability. By allowing agents to interpret and execute instructions in natural language, this framework enhances the overall efficiency and responsiveness of manufacturing processes. The authors demonstrate that LLMs can effectively bridge the gap between complex human instructions and machine understanding, paving the way for a more flexible and intelligent operational landscape. Through concrete case studies, the findings reveal the potential of employing language models to enhance agent collaboration and decision-making in various contexts.\\n\\n## Conceptual Discussion\\nThe convergence of LLMs and agent architectures presents a dynamic frontier for AI research. The papers discussed highlight a common trend: the transition from simple task-response systems to more nuanced models capable of understanding context, reasoning, and learning from experience. Objective benchmarks, like the STSS, play a pivotal role in evaluating agent capabilities, providing transparency that can drive improvements. Likewise, the integration of feedback mechanisms, showcased by the Retroformer, illustrates the necessity for agents to adapt continuously.
